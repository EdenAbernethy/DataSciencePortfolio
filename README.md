# DataSciencePortfolio
This is a collection of projects I've worked on as a Data Science Honors Student at Xavier University

First up I have graphs and code from the intership that my cohort did over the summer. Xavier University paid us to look at a confidential data set and to look at retention rates of their students. We were asked to build a profile of who and who was not returning to Xavier both fall semester to the spring semester and year to year. 

Since the data set is confidential, I will only be able to add the code and not the data set we used.

Secondly in a course we took in the fall of 2023 we worked with other sophomores in the PPP (Philosophy, Politics & the Public) program at Xavier. They were on the campaign track and were working to campaign with people running for the local city council in Cincinnati, Ohio. We were tasked with helping them make graphs on the geneal population of Cincinnati using the census data, as well as looking at past elections and building base and swing maps.
